Nokia L3VPN Telemetry Lab Demo using: 
- Transport: Base SRv6, FlexAlgo 128
- Service: EVPN IFL (Interface-less)

This lab is showing a simple configuration and verification of SRv6 on Nokia routers to signal both IGPâ€™s shortest path and Algorithms with specific metric conditions (i.e. 10ms). All router network interfaces for transport are using IPv6 and we are encpasulating IPv4 traffic.
